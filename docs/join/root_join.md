# Join InterSystems Open Exchange

The primary goal of InterSystems Open Exchange is to provide a collaborative platform for developers, users, and partners within the InterSystems community to share and exchange solutions, tools, applications, and integrations built on InterSystems technologies. Open Exchange aims to foster innovation, knowledge sharing, and collaboration among users of InterSystems products, such as InterSystems IRIS Data Platform, Cache, Ensemble, and others.

The platform itself does not directly host any applications. Instead, it offers the opportunity to publish your applications that are hosted on external platforms such as GitHub or GitLab. However, it currently only integrates with GitHub and GitLab, allowing users to retrieve open data directly from these repositories.

If your code is openly available and hosted on another platform, that's also acceptable. However, you'll need to allocate additional time to complete the application form and regularly update your application description manually to keep it current.
