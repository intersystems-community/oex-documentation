## Header

Here, you'll find:
 - App name and logo
 - Notification indicating if the application is supported by InterSystems or not
 - App statistics including:
   - Rating
   - Quantity of awards (if any)
   - Number of views of the app page
   - Count of IPM installs (if the app has this module)

You have the choice to either subscribe to receive notifications regarding app updates or simply bookmark it to avoid receiving newsletters. Bookmarked apps can be accessed in the bookmarks section of your developer portal.

Additionally, you have the option to share the app and access its external page by clicking on the main button.
