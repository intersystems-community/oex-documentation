# Applications catalog

You'll find the applications catalog on the main page of InterSystems Open Exchange. You can use filters and search options to discover various available apps.

On the app tile, you'll see:
 - App name
 - Short description
 - Rating
 - Category
 - Author
 - Number of app page views
 - IPM installs number (if the app has an IPM module) and its install count

Upon hovering, you'll view the technologies used in the app. 

Clicking on the app author reveals their public profile page link and some stats.

Additional details:
 - Blue stroke indicates InterSystems support.
 - A blue upper stroke denotes a featured app.
