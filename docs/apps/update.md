## Update an application

All updates made to your applications within GitHub or GitLab repositories will be automatically reflected on Open Exchange. However, if there are specific elements that aren't retrieved from the repositories—such as InterSystems products or categories—such updates should be managed directly within the Open Exchange platform.

There are various ways to access application editing:

1. Visit your application's public profile.
2. Look for the edit icon next to your app's name.
3. Click the icon to open the editing form for modifications.

While adding changes, fields will be highlighted with an exclamation mark. This indicates that these changes have not been published yet. As soon as you send your edits for approval and they are approved, you will no longer see these signs.

When you're prepared to publish your changes, you'll be prompted to decide whether you want to publish a release alongside or solely update the information about your app on the website. You can choose the option that best suits your case.

**Release app**: will guide you through filling out a release form where you can specify the release number and describe what's new in your app. This information will be published on the release notes page of the website and will also be sent out to your subscribers.

**Send edits**: imply initiates the app approval process. Upon acceptance, your changes will be reflected online, but no release will be published as part of this action.
