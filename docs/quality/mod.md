## Moderation

Our moderators consistently review apps and assign statuses such as "Works" if they can be launched and used, and "Doesn't work" if an app is outdated due to a lack of updates from the author.

During the app review process, our moderators may create pull requests. We recommend reviewing these to keep your apps up-to-date. If you no longer plan to support an app, consider unpublishing it.

Where to view the statuses:

**For other authors' apps**: If the app was checked, you'll find the date and status in the info box on the app's public page.

**For your own app**: The status can be seen on the app's public page under the "Reports" tab. This tab becomes visible if there is at least one report from the moderator.
