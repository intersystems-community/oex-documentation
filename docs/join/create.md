## Create an account
If you have previously logged in to any of the InterSystems platforms, such as the [Developer Community](https://community.intersystems.com/), [General Masters platform](https://globalmasters.intersystems.com/), or [Learning platform](https://learning.intersystems.com/) or others, that means you already have an InterSystems SSO account.

Simply use the same credentials to log in to [InterSystems Open Exchange](https://marketplace.intersystems.com/), and your Open Exchange account will be automatically created.

If you haven't visited any of the InterSystems platforms before, click on the 'Get started' button and follow the steps to create a new InterSystems SSO account. Once you've created your account, you can use it to log in to the Open Exchange platform or any other InterSystems platform.
